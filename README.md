📌 Project Overview

This project presents a machine learning / deep learning model for Dengue Fever Prediction developed as part of a Final Year Project (FYP).

The system analyzes epidemiological and/or environmental features to predict dengue-related outcomes using data-driven techniques.

The notebook includes:

Data preprocessing

Feature selection

Model training

Model evaluation

Prediction results

Performance metrics

🗂 Dataset

Dataset Name: dengue_final_dataset

The dataset contains structured features used for training and evaluating the prediction model.

Ensure the dataset file is available before running the notebook.
